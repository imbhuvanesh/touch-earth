Touch Earth is a mindful Android app designed to reduce excessive screen time by reconnecting users with the real world.
Instead of forcing limits, Touch Earth gently encourages outdoor presence by temporarily locking distracting apps until the user steps outside and completes a simple nature check.

Users select apps to block, set focus sessions, and regain access only after verifying real outdoor surroundings through a camera-based nature detection system. The experience is intentionally calm, pressure-free, and minimal, promoting balance, awareness, and presence over pixels.

Core highlights:

Smart app blocking using Android Usage Access

Outdoor verification via camera and nature detection

Peaceful UI with soft language and minimalist design

Focus sessions, breaks, and flexible schedules

Encouragement without guilt or punishment

Touch Earth is not about control.
It’s about remembering the world beyond the screen 🌍
